# Changelog V1.1
Added a ranking system for relics. After submitting a relic it's ranked from D to S++ Tier for each character. Every character is then displayed   for you to see how the relic lines up for everybody.
Additionally, added the relic sets added since 2.7, it's now accurate up to version 3.1. This includes the following relics:
- Hero of Triumphant Song & Poet of Mourning Collapse (Cavern Relics)
- Bone Collection's Serene Demesne & Giant Tree of Rapt Brooding (Planar Ornaments)
Version 2.0 is the next big update. I want to add the ability to save relics under specific characters to build profiles for several characters, this should rank character builds overall too.
Before 2.0, I may try and implement ranking up relics, since that has been an idea for a bit now, I'm just unsure how to do it.

# Changelog V1.0
Added the ability to, y'know, actually choose an artifact. Can't do any rating yet, but you're able to choose from all current relics up to Version 2.7.
The primary focus for this was to allow the user to select the specific cavern relic/planar ornament set, then choose main stats from a table that would change depending on the chosen piece.
Though, visuals were also focused on. Got a basic style sheet and image selection working, and now there's some pretty colors going on.
