Ok basically, each substat has 3 values you can roll when you get the relic. A low end, a mid end, and a high end. For example, flat HP on a 5 star relic has a low end of +33, a mid end of +38, and a high end of +42. Whenever you enhance the relic enough to upgrade a substat, the substat will be upgraded by an equal amount to it's original value. so a relic piece that upgraded a mid end flat HP substat will mean it has a value of 76.

Prywden has a good chart for this, basically just check to see if the substat is a multiple of low end, mid end, or high end stats. It's possible that its not a multiple of any of them however, Kafka had a +2 8.6 atk% substat, which doesn't work with any of the low end, mid end, or high end numbers for atk%. It should instead be a 4.3%, but the high end is 4.4%. Maybe this is a rounding thing, but who knows. Maybe make each end span a bit more than only a tenth of a percentage.
